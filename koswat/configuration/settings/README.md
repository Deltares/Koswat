## Koswat settings.

Contains the `DataObjectModelProtocol` instances representing a `Koswat`settings configuration.

All settings classes should implement the `KoswatConfigProtocol` contract.

__Note__: `KoswatCostsSettings` has been placed in its own module (`koswat.configuration.settings.costs_setting`) because of all its related subsettings.
