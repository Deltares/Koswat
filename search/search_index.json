Location report : Which profile reinforcements can be applied to each location based on their surroundings and reinforcement properties ( MultiLocationProfileCostReport ). Infrastructure report : ( InfrastructureLocationProfileCostReport ) Costs related to applying all calculated reinforcement profiles at the locations where infrastructures are present. Profile report : ( ProfileCostReport ), what are the (material) volume costs associated when applying a given reinforced profile . Layer report : A sub report of the 'profile report' which breaks down the different costs of each one of the layers. This can be seen in Image 1 Volume costs . Image 1. Volume costs Infrastructure report \u00b6 When determining the costs of infrastructures we look mainly at: The reinforcement profile ( ReinforcementProfileProtocol ) zones A and B. The distance between a dike and an infrastructure ( SurroundingsInfrastructure.points , PointSurroundings.surroundings_matrix ). These characteristics are then used to estimate how much surface of the infrastructures will be affected by the reinforced profile and therefore their associated cost. Reinforcement profile zones \u00b6 A reinforced profile can be different from its original state in many ways, however here we are only intestered in two things: The new profile's width from the original waterside crest point. Whether there is a crest's height increase ( dh0 ), By using the old and the reinforced profile's geometries, we can determine what we call zone A and zone B , A + B = {profile's width from waterside crest point} . Zone A represents the width of the dike old profile's crest (highest surface). Zone B the distance between said crest and the end of the dike's reinforcement. Image 1. Reinforcement with dh0 = 0 However, when the crest's height of a ReinforcementProfileProtocol has increased in comparison to its original profile ( ReinforcementProfileProtocol.old_profile , KoswatProfileProtocol ) then we set zone A = 0 and therefore B = {profile's width from waterside crest point} . Image 2. Reinforcement with dh0 = 1 Infrastructure's distances \u00b6 An infrastructure ( SurroundingsInfrastructure ) can be present at different locations ( SurroundingsInfrastructure.points ). Each of these locations ( PointSurroundings ) contains a dictionary ( surroundings_matrix: dict[float, float] ) where the key is the distance between said location and the infrastructure and the values represent the length of the infrastructure found at that distance. For instance, we could have surroundings_matrix = {5: 1.5, 10: 0, 15: 2.5} , which means: - Between 0 and 5 meters from the location we will find 1.5 meters of the infrastructure, - Between 5 and 10 meters from the location we will find 0 meters of the infrastructure, - Between 10 and 15 meters from the location we will find 2.5 meters of the infrastructure. In addition, each infrastructure has a fixed width ( SurroundingsInfrastructure.infrastructure_width ), which can later be used to calculate the total surface of said infrastructure affected by the given profile. So: affected_infra_zone_x = meters_of_infrastructure_in_zone_x * infrastructure_width , where meters_of_infrastructure_in_zone_x are the values calculated from the surroundings_matrix and infrastructure_width is the infrastructure fixed width. Cost calculation \u00b6 After defining the profile's zones A and B we can easily find how much of each infrastructures is affected by checking the surroundings_matrix indices and \"rounding\" up. It is agreed that at the overlapping points between A and B , the affected surface, and therefore costs, will only be computed for zone A ; this is done regardless of the chosen infrastructure costs type ( InfraCostsEnum ). Once the total area is known, we only need to multiply them by their related costs for adding and/or removing infrastructure's material. Example \u00b6 Using as example the previous surroundings_matrix = {5: 1.5, 10: 0, 15: 2.5} we can demostrate this when A = 4 and B = 10 . Estimate zone limits: zone_a goes from 0 to 4, zone_b goes from 4 to 14. Estimate affected points in the surroundings matrix: zone_a affects only up until key 5 , so 1.5 meters of infrastructure. zone_b affects keys 10 and 15 , so 2.5 meters of infrastructure. Note that we do not take 5 as has already been considered for zone_a . Generated files \u00b6 After running a Koswat analysis, several files and directories will be generated.

Scenario: Scenario being applied to the selected dike profile. Dike section: The selected dike section being analyzed. Generated files: A combination of images and a 'csv' matrix result.

A strategy requires a strategy input ( StrategyInput ), this input contains information over which reinforcement types are available at each location as well as what's the minimal buffer ( reinforcement_min_buffer ) and minimal length ( reinforcement_min_length ) for each reinforcement type. By default a strategy is applied as follows: For each point (meter) in the traject, determine which reinforcements can be applied to it. Choose one of the available reinforcements based on the chosen strategy . When no reinforcement is available the most restrictive will be chosen ( CofferDam ). Apply a buffer ( reinforcement_min_buffer ) for each one of the reinforcements. Check if the minimal distance between constructions is met ( reinforcement_min_length ), otherwise change it into one of the reinforcements next to it. Repeat 4 until all reinforcements have enough distance between themselves. Find based on the strategy for infrastructure derived costs , mapped locations ( list[StrategyLocationReinforcement] ) whose reinforcement can be increased into a most restrictive one with total lower costs. Return list of mapped locations ( list[StrategyLocationReinforcement] ). Available strategies \u00b6 Currently the following strategies are implemented: Order based Infrastructure priority , by default the strategy to run during a Koswat analysis. Order based \u00b6 This strategy is the first and default of all defined strategies. Its criteria is based on a pre-defined 'order' of each reinforcement. In steps, it can be seen as: Pre-selection of a location's available reinforcement based on said order, when a location does not have any \"available\" reinforcement, then the last reinforcement's order will be pre-selected. Grouping of all locations by their pre-selected reinforcement. Buffering to each of the groupings. Clustering to the resulting groupings from the previous step. Reinforcement order \u00b6 The reinforcements are ordered based on increasing cost (including surtax) and decreasing width. Reinforcements that are more expensive but are wider or have equal width are skipped (order -1 ). The CofferDamReinforcementProfile will never be skipped and is always the last reinforcement that is applied in case no other reinforcement fits the surroundings. Reinforcement type Profile width Cost with surtax Index SoilReinforcementProfile 10 100 0 VPSReinforcementProfile 20 200 -1 PipingWallReinforcementProfile 10 300 -1 StabilityWallReinforcementProfile 5 400 1 CofferDamReinforcementProfile 0 500 2 Reinforcement grouping \u00b6 We create reinforcement-location \"grouping\" for the whole traject. A grouping represents a reinforcement type that is \"selected\" for a series of continuous locations. This means locations that are next to each other sharing the same measure type ( Type[ReinforcementProfileProtocol] ). Grouping example \u00b6 Simplified representation for a traject with 10 locations. This example is also tested in the tests.strategies.order_strategy.py test file. { \"SoilReinforcementProfile\" : [ \"Location_000\" , \"Location_001\" , \"Location_002\" , ], \"StabilityWallReinforcementProfile\" : [ \"Location_003\" , \"Location_004\" , ], \"SoilReinforcementProfile\" : [ \"Location_005\" , \"Location_006\" , \"Location_007\" , ], \"CofferDamReinforcementProfile\" : [ \"Location_008\" , \"Location_009\" , ], } Reinforcement buffering \u00b6 Given a reinforcement grouping , we will create a dictionary of masks of size NM where N (the keys) is the number of available reinforcement types ( Type[ReinforcementProfileProtocol] ) and M the number of available locations. Note : Masks' values are the position of a reinforcement type in the reinforcement's order list . So a location with CofferDamReinforcementProfile will have a 4 at the mask's position, whilst a SoilReinforcementProfile will have a 0 instead (remember in Python indexing starts with 0). Steps breakdown : Initialize the dictionary masks with all values to -1. Iterate over the groupings list, and for each entry: Select the mask to update using the grouping's reinforcement type (cluster's key). Update the indices representing the grouping's locations (grouping's values) with the matching value for this grouping's key (see previous note ). Add a buffer ( StrategyInput.reinforcement_min_buffer ) by updating the adjacent's positions of this grouping with the same values as in step 1. Merge all masks into a 1-dimensional array where the cell's value is the maximum between the available masks. This is done to prevent that a buffer of a \"stronger\" demanding reinforcement such as CofferDamReinforcementProfile is replaced by a \"weaker\" one. Update the locations with their new associated reinforcement. The resulting mask contains the index of the reinforcement to be applied in the reinforcement's order . Buffering example \u00b6 One simplified example, based on the grouping example , and using a buffer value of \"1\".

We do this by updating their type with the one of a \"stronger\" adjacent grouping, on this section called \"clusters\". These clusters are internally represented by the class OrderCluster . The strategy here is to detect non-compliant reinforcement-location clusters and replace their selected reinforcement type with the \"least strong\" of its adjacent clusters. We do this iteratively, so we first target the lowest type of reinforcements ( SoilReinforcementProfile ) and we move up until the first to the last (the last one cannot be further strengthened). Conditions : We define a non-compliant cluster as a cluster that does not contain as many locations as defined by the minimal length requirement ( reinforcement_min_length ). We also define a non-compliant exception when a cluster does not meet said requirement but the adjacent clusters are of a lower reinforcement type. Therefore retaining their initial reinforcement type. The first and last clusters, are always considered compliant . Therefore they retain their initial reinforcement type. Clusters whose reinforcement type is placed the last in the strategy's order , are skipped and always considered compliant , as they cannot be further strengthened. Steps breakdown : Generate a list of all available unmerged clusters. For each reinforcement type target-reinforcement , in the strategy order: Get the current non-compliant clusters For each non-compliant target-reinforcement cluster : Check if its indeed not compliant. Otherwise move to the next cluster. Get a stronger cluster among the neighbors. Selects the neighbor with the \"weakest\", yet greater than the actual, reinforcement type value. If both neighbors are \"weaker\" than the current reinforcement type, then it is considered an \"exception\" as it cannot be further strengthened. We therefore move to the next non-compliant cluster. Move the current cluster's locations to the stronger reinforcement cluster. Remove the cluster from the \"available clusters\" list as it is integrated in step 2.2.3.

These costs are extracted from the cost report and relate to the reinforcement profile costs (dike's materials for the required space) and the possible infrastructure costs . In steps, this strategy can be broke down as: Steps breakdown : Assignment of order based clusters , Cluster options evaluation, Common available measures cost calculation, Cheapest option selection, Update reinforcement selection with selected option. Cluster options \u00b6 For an optimal assignment of a new reinforcement profile, we make use of \"subclusters\". These subclusters are contiguous subsets from an order based cluster and have the minimal required length ( StrategyInput.reinforcement_min_cluster ). The logic for this section can be found in InfraPriorityStrategy.generate_subcluster_options . For each of original the clusters, multiple combinations of subclusters are possible. We refer to them as \" cluster option \" ( InfraClusterOption ) . We can already discard creating subclusters when the size of the original cluster is less than twice the required minimal length. So for a minimal length of 2 locations, you require a cluster of at least 4 locations to generate subclusters. Conditions : We only create subclusters when the cluster's original size is, at least, twice the required minimal cluster's length. We estimate the cluster's minimal length to be at least twice the size of the buffer so: min_cluster_length = (2 * reinforcement_min_buffer) + 1 . We create subclusters based on the immediate results of the order based strategy . We do not try to combine or create new clusters based on a \"greedier\" strategy. Cluster option example \u00b6 For example, given the results of the clustering example we can calculate the options for the clusters for a required minimal length of 2 : List of clusters: { ( 0 , [ \"Location_000\" , \"Location_001\" ,] ) , ( 3 , [ \"Location_002\" , \"Location_003\" , \"Location_004\" , \"Location_005\" , \"Location_006\" ,] ) , ( 4 , [ \"Location_007\" , \"Location_008\" , \"Location_009\" ,] ) , } Options for cluster {(0, [\"Location_000\",\"Location_001\",])} - Valid op t io ns : ( 0 , [ \"Location_000\" , \"Location_001\" ,] ) Options for cluster {(3, [\"Location_002\",\"Location_003\", \"Location_004\",\"Location_005\", \"Location_006\",])} - Valid : - {[ \"Location_002\" , \"Location_003\" ], [ \"Location_004\" , \"Location_005\" , \"Location_006\" ]}, - {[ \"Location_002\" , \"Location_003\" , \"Location_004\" ], [ \"Location_005\" , \"Location_006\" ]} - I n valid : - f irs t subclus ter 's size is less t ha n required : {[ \"Location_002\" ], [ \"Location_003\" , \"Location_004\" ], [ \"Location_005\" , \"Location_006\" ]} - las t subclus ter 's size is less t ha n required : {[ \"Location_002\" , \"Location_003\" ], [ \"Location_004\" , \"Location_005\" ], [ \"Location_006\" ]}, - seco n d subclus ter 's size is less t ha n required : {[ \"Location_002\" , \"Location_003\" ], [ \"Location_004\" ], [ \"Location_005\" , \"Location_006\" ]}, - a n d so o n ... Options for cluster {(4, [\"Location_007\",\"Location_008\",\"Location_009\",]),} - Valid : - {[ \"Location_007\" , \"Location_008\" , \"Location_009\" ,]} - I n valid : - f irs t subclus ter 's size is less t ha n required : {[ \"Location_007\" ], [ \"Location_008\" , \"Location_009\" ]} - las t subclus ter 's size is less t ha n required : {[ \"Location_007\" , \"Location_008\" ], [ \"Location_009\" ]} - a n d so o n ... Cluster common available measures' cost \u00b6 Once we have calculated a cluster's option we can determine whether this cluster should be consider as a valid one. This estimation is based on the cheapest reinforcement's cost (including surtax), and to get this value we first need to know which reinforcements are available at all the locations of this option. We will store this value in the InfraClusterOption.cluster_costs . In the current implementation, these costs are added to the InfraClusterOption together with the cluster's data ( list[InfraCluster] ). Conditions : A \"viable\" cluster option must be cheaper than the order's cluster and has the cluster's minimal length. We consider \"minimal costs\" or \"lower costs\" as the lowest cost of applying a certain reinforcement type to a given subcluster.

This example is based on the first approach of this strategy and its steps might differ from the current solution. We left this example as it can help understanding the basic concepts of the strategy. We will start by defining some unrealistic costs per reinforcement type for all locations* such as. For a more realistic scenario check the subclustering example : Index Reinforcement type base cost infra cost total cost 0 Soil reinforcement 42 420.000 420.042 1 Vertical Piping Solution 420 420.000 420.420 2 Piping Wall 4200 0 4200 3 Stability Wall 42.000 420.000 462.000 4 Cofferdam 420.000 0 420.000 Important! For example purposes we are applying the same infrastructure costs to all the locations. |However, in a real case these costs would vary per location (and per reinforcement type). So we can determine the cluster's reinforcement costs as (total cost) * N locations Based on this data Piping Wall will be chosen unless any of the points in the cluster cannot apply it due to obstacles or other constraints, in which case it would end up settling for a Cofferdam reinforcement. Let's see now the strategy steps using the results from the clustering example : 1.

The strategy here is to detect non-compliant reinforcement-location clusters and replace their selected reinforcement type with the \"least strong\" of its adjacent clusters. We do this iteratively, so we first target the lowest type of reinforcements ( SoilReinforcementProfile ) and we move up until the first to the last (the last one cannot be further strengthened).

Therefore retaining their initial reinforcement type. The first and last clusters, are always considered compliant . Therefore they retain their initial reinforcement type.

In the current implementation, these costs are added to the InfraClusterOption together with the cluster's data ( list[InfraCluster] ). Conditions : A \"viable\" cluster option must be cheaper than the order's cluster and has the cluster's minimal length. We consider \"minimal costs\" or \"lower costs\" as the lowest cost of applying a certain reinforcement type to a given subcluster.","title":"Cluster common available measures' cost"},{"location":"reference/koswat_strategies.html#common-available-measures-cost-example","text":"Following the options example we can estimate some fictional costs based on the following tables (if a type / location is not mentioned, then assume its cost is zero ( 0 )): Index Reinforcement type base cost incl. surtax 0 Soil reinforcement 42 1 Vertical Piping Solution 420 2 Piping Wall 4.200 3 Stability Wall 42.000 4 Cofferdam 420.000 Location Reinforcement indices Infrastructure cost incl. surtax Location_000 0, 1 4.200.000 Location_005 0, 1, 2, 3 4.200.000 We already know that only the second cluster can generate subclusters, therefore different valid options, so we will use said subcluster's options for the example. 1.

This example is based on the first approach of this strategy and its steps might differ from the current solution.

During our analyisis we make use of ( .shp ) maps where a dike's traject is shown together with all the human-built structures in its proximity. We categorize these structures in the following two types: Obstacles , surroundings that cannot be modified in any way. Infrastructures , as opposite to the obstacles, surroundings that can be repaired or removed and added again (elsewhere). Image 1. Surroundings representation To define said surroundings we make use of .csv files, each file for a specific type of surrounding that needs to be \"enabled\" in the koswat_general.json settings file. In addition, surroundings can be defined for the inside or the outside of a dike. At the current Koswat version (unreleased v0.15.0 ) we only support surroundings in the inside of a dike ( binnendijks ). Surroundings .csv files \u00b6 The surroundings files follow all the same format both in naming and content. Their file name has the form of T{dike_traject}_{type_of_surrounding}.csv : - The {dike_traject} is the dike's traject code name, usually something like 10_1 , - the {type_of_surrounding} is the name of surrounding that will be imported (check further in the corresponding subsections of obstacles and infrastructure ). Their headers are divided in the following columns: SECTIE , section of the location in the dike's traject, Xcoord , x coordinate of the location, Ycoord , y coordinate of the location, afst_{x}m , distance from the reference point of the location, where 'x' are all the values between 5 and 200 with steps of 5, thus 40 columns. The values in these cells define whether there are obstacles or infrastructures at this distance or not and in Koswat are usually built in the SurroundingsPoint.surroundings_matrix , each type of surrounding interprets the weights in a different manner. Obstacles \u00b6 An obstacle usually represents a building. Because they cannot be removed they become a constraint to the possible reinforcements that can be applied at a given location. For instance, if a dike's reinforcement will become 5 meters wider, but within that distance there are obstacles, said reinforcement will be discarded as a possible option at that location. The distance from the reference point of the dike to the closes point of the obstacle is given. The values in the columns afst_{x}m are either 1 or 0 and are simply interpreted as having a surrounding or not. Thus ignoring other characteristics of the surrounding and just focusing on its presence. Obstacle types \u00b6 Currently we identify and support the following surroundings as written in the .csv file names: bebouwing_binnendijks (buildings), spoorwegen_binnendijks (railways), waters_binnendijks (waters), As reminder, at the moment we only support 'inside the dike's' surroundings. Infrastructures \u00b6 Infrastructures are mostly \"roads\". Contrary to the obstacles these infrastructures do not become a boundary for a reinforcement and they will simply be either displaced or repaired when applying a reinforcement requires their space. When this occurs, it is reflected as additional costs for the given type of reinforcement at that location. In short, these costs are calculated based on: The width of the infrastructure (taken from the Koswat_general.json settings), The length of the infrastructure at that location (the values in the columns afst_{x}m ), The required technique (repair, displace, nothing) for the type of infrastructure (also from koswat_general.json settings) and its related costs ( koswat_costs.json ). With the above values we know what's the affected area of an infrastructure when a reinforced profile needs to be applied and therefore can estimate their costs. The distance from the reference point of the dike to the center point of the infrastructure is given. Infrastructures types \u00b6 Currently we identify and support the following surroundings as written in the .csv file names: wegen_binnendijks_klasse2 (roads class 2), wegen_binnendijks_klasse7 (roads class 7), wegen_binnendijks_klasse24 (roads class 24), wegen_binnendijks_klasse47 (roads class 47), wegen_binnendijks_klasseonbekend (roads of unknown class), As reminder, at the moment we only support 'inside the dike's' surroundings.
