# Examples

You can run all our examples in a [koswat binder environment](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Deltares/koswat/jupyter-binder), based on the [jupyter-binder](https://github.com/Deltares/Koswat/tree/jupyter-binder?tab=readme-ov-file) long-living branch.

- Simple runs:
    - [Koswat from command line](https://github.com/Deltares/Koswat/blob/jupyter-binder/koswat_run_as_command_line.md)
    - [Koswat as python package](https://github.com/Deltares/Koswat/blob/jupyter-binder/koswat_run_as_python_package.ipynb)
